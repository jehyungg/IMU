#XSENS_NANO_plotting
Attach XSENS DOT and Arduino NANO 33 IoT to compare two datas from different quality of IMU sensor.

## Method 
1. Attach XSENS DOT and Arduino NANO 33 IoT together.
2. Start collecting the data by moving two sensors together.
3. Make sure two sensors collect its data with same Hz. If not, make the frame equivalent by adjusting codes.
4. Synchronize two data.
5. Plot two graphs in same figure
6. Calculate the difference between two data by using RMS method.
7. Modify the parameter of the filter and repeat the procedure until it reduces the error.


## Hardware
1. XSENS DOT
